## What are Tokens?

### Understanding Tokenization

**Tokens** are the fundamental units that AI models use to process and understand text. Think of tokens as the "words" that AI models understand, but they're not always the same as human words.

#### How Tokenization Works

**The Process:**
1. **Input Text:** "grew a pretty little fir-tree; and yet it was not happy"
2. **Tokenization:** Text is broken down into individual tokens
3. **Result:** ["grew", "a", "pretty", "little", "fir", "tree", "and", "yet", "it", "was", "not", "happy"]

#### Key Concepts:

**Token Types:**
- **Words:** Complete words like "hello", "world"
- **Subwords:** Parts of words like "un-", "-ing", "-ed"
- **Punctuation:** Individual punctuation marks
- **Special Characters:** Spaces, symbols, emojis

**Why Tokens Matter:**
- **Processing:** AI models process text token by token
- **Cost:** You pay per token used
- **Limits:** Models have maximum token limits
- **Performance:** Token count affects response time

### Visual Example: Tokenization Process

*[Insert your tokenization diagram here showing how sentences are broken into tokens]*

**Example Breakdown:**
```
Original Text: "The sun shone, and the soft air fluttered its leaves"

Tokens: ["The", "sun", "shone", ",", "and", "the", "soft", "air", "fluttered", "its", "leaves"]
```

### Practical Token Counting

**üìù Try This Prompt in ChatGPT:**
```
Count the tokens in this text: "Artificial intelligence is transforming how we work and live. From chatbots to autonomous vehicles, AI is becoming increasingly sophisticated."

Please break down the text into individual tokens and provide the total count. Also explain how you determined what constitutes a token.
```

## Token Limits and Management

### Understanding Token Limits

**Token Limits** are the maximum number of tokens a model can process in a single interaction. These limits vary by model and affect both input and output.

#### Types of Token Limits:

**Input Token Limit:**
- Maximum tokens you can send to the model
- Includes your prompt, context, and conversation history
- Varies by model (e.g., GPT-4: 128k tokens, Claude-3: 200k tokens)

**Output Token Limit:**
- Maximum tokens the model can generate in response
- Usually much smaller than input limits
- Affects response length and completeness

### Model Token Limits Comparison

*[Insert your model comparison chart here]*

**Popular Models and Their Limits:**

| Model | Input Tokens | Output Tokens | Cost per 1M Input | Cost per 1M Output |
|-------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| GPT-4 | 128,000 | 4,096 | $30.00 | $60.00 |
| GPT-4 Turbo | 128,000 | 4,096 | $10.00 | $30.00 |
| Claude-3 Opus | 200,000 | 4,096 | $15.00 | $75.00 |
| Claude-3 Sonnet | 200,000 | 4,096 | $3.00 | $15.00 |

### Exercise: Explore OpenAI Pricing

**Step 1: Navigate to OpenAI Pricing**
1. Go to Google and search "OpenAI pricing"
2. Click on the official OpenAI pricing page
3. Explore the different models and their costs

**Step 2: Compare Models**
- **Input tokens:** Cost for sending data to the model
- **Cached input tokens:** Reduced cost for repeated context
- **Output tokens:** Cost for model responses

**üìù Try This Prompt in ChatGPT:**
```
I need to process a 50,000-word document with GPT-4. The document will be sent as input, and I need a 2,000-word summary as output.

Calculate the approximate cost for this task using current OpenAI pricing. Show your calculations step by step.

Input: 50,000 words ‚âà 65,000 tokens (assuming 1.3 tokens per word)
Output: 2,000 words ‚âà 2,600 tokens

Please provide the cost breakdown and suggest the most cost-effective approach.

### Approaches to Avoid Hitting Token Limits

#### 1. **Use Different Models**
- **Strategy:** Choose models with higher token limits
- **Example:** Use Claude-3 (200k tokens) instead of GPT-4 (128k tokens)
- **Trade-off:** Different models have different capabilities and costs

#### 2. **Shortening Your Prompt/Context**
- **Strategy:** Remove unnecessary information
- **Techniques:**
  - Remove redundant examples
  - Use abbreviations
  - Focus on essential information only

**üìù Try This Prompt in ChatGPT:**
```
Optimize this prompt to reduce token count while maintaining effectiveness:

Original: "I need you to analyze this business proposal and provide a comprehensive evaluation including market analysis, financial projections, risk assessment, competitive landscape, target audience analysis, and recommendations for improvement. Please be thorough and detailed in your response."

Target: Reduce by at least 30% while keeping the same functionality.
```

*[Take screenshot of ChatGPT response here]*

#### 3. **Chunking**
- **Strategy:** Break large documents into smaller pieces
- **Process:** Process each chunk separately, then combine results
- **Use Case:** Large documents, books, extensive datasets

#### 4. **Windowed Chunks**
- **Strategy:** Use overlapping chunks to maintain context
- **Benefit:** Prevents loss of information at chunk boundaries
- **Example:** Process pages 1-10, then 8-18, then 16-26

#### 5. **Summarization**
- **Strategy:** Summarize previous context before adding new information
- **Process:** 
  1. Summarize conversation history
  2. Add new information
  3. Continue conversation
- **Benefit:** Maintains context while reducing tokens

**üìù Try This Prompt in ChatGPT:**
```
I have a long conversation history that's approaching the token limit. Please help me create a summary that preserves the key information while reducing the token count.

Here's the conversation:
[Insert your conversation history]

Create a concise summary that captures:
1. Main topics discussed
2. Key decisions made
3. Important context
4. Current state of the conversation

Target: Reduce to 20% of original length while maintaining essential information.
```

## Chat Models vs Reasoning Models

### What is a Chat Model?

**Chat Models** are large language models designed for conversational interactions. They process sequences of messages and return message-based responses.

#### Chat Model Characteristics:

**Message Types:**
1. **System Message:** Instructions from the developer (sets behavior)
2. **User Message:** Input from the user
3. **AI Message:** Response from the model

**Key Features:**
- **Low Latency:** Fast response times
- **Streaming:** Responses generated token by token
- **Conversational:** Designed for back-and-forth interaction
- **Real-time:** Immediate responses

### What are Reasoning Models?

**Reasoning Models** use "Test Time Compute Scaling" - they allocate extra processing time to think through problems before responding.

#### Reasoning Model Characteristics:

**Test Time Compute Scaling:**
- **Extra Processing Time:** Models "think" before responding
- **Problem-Solving:** Better at complex, multi-step problems
- **Quality Over Speed:** Prioritizes accuracy over speed
- **Human-like Reasoning:** Similar to how humans spend more time on difficult tasks

**Key Features:**
- **High Latency:** Longer response times
- **High Reasoning Capabilities:** Better at complex problems
- **Deep Analysis:** More thorough problem-solving
- **Accuracy:** Reduced errors on complex tasks

### Visual Example: GPT-5 Thinking Process

*[Insert your GPT-5 thinking diagram here showing the multi-turn process with reasoning time]*

**The Process:**
1. **Input:** User query
2. **Reasoning:** Model allocates thinking time
3. **Output:** Well-reasoned response

**3. **Inconsistent Information**
- **Warning Sign:** Contradictory statements in same response
- **Action:** Point out inconsistencies and ask for clarification

**4. **Unusual or Implausible Claims**
- **Warning Sign:** Information that seems too good to be true
- **Action:** Verify through multiple sources

**üìù Try This Prompt in ChatGPT:**
```
I'm researching the history of artificial intelligence. Please provide information about the development of neural networks, but I want you to be very careful about accuracy.

For each claim you make, please:
1. State your confidence level (high/medium/low)
2. Indicate if you're uncertain about any details
3. Suggest how I could verify the information
4. Flag any areas where you might be less reliable

This will help me identify what to double-check.
```

- **Benefit:** Encourages self-correction

#### 5. **Iterative Verification**
- **Strategy:** Ask follow-up questions
- **Example:** "Can you provide more details about X?"
- **Benefit:** Reveals inconsistencies or gaps

**üìù Try This Prompt in ChatGPT:**
```
I need accurate information about climate change impacts on agriculture. Please provide a comprehensive overview, but use this approach:

1. Start with your most confident information
